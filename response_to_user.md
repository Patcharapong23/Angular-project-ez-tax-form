I have updated the stylesheet at `c:\Users\Admin\Downloads\Angular-project-ez-tax-form-main\Angular-project-ez-tax-form-main\src\app\features\products\dialogs\product-dialog\product-dialog.component.css` to ensure the "Price per unit" and "Tax rate" fields have a consistent appearance.

The changes include:
1.  Matching the border radius of the dropdown to the input field.
2.  Aligning the height of the dropdown with the input field by applying the same padding.

These adjustments should resolve the visual inconsistency. I have completed the request.
